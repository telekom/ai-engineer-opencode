## About

opencode is an open source AI coding agent for the terminal, desktop and IDE.

This repository is the T-Systems **AI Engineer (AIE)** fork of [opencode](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode). The upstream code is kept untouched on the `dev` branch; all AIE changes live on the `aie` branch (the default branch of this repository) and are documented below.

## Changes to the official Repository

All changes to the upstream project made in this fork are listed here. Please add a row for every change you make on the `aie` branch.

| Date | Change | Where | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-09-21 | REUSE compliance setup from [telekom/reuse-template](https://github.com/telekom/reuse-template): `REUSE.toml`, license texts in `LICENSES/`, REUSE Compliance Check workflow, SPDX header in `.gitignore` | `REUSE.toml`, `LICENSES/`, `.github/workflows/reuse-compliance.yml`, `.gitignore` | Deutsche Telekom OSPO open source publishing requirements |
| 2026-09-21 | Replaced the upstream README with this fork README (link to the official README, change log, Code of Conduct and Licensing sections) | `README.md` | Document fork changes and licensing |
| 2026-09-21 | Added OSS Review Toolkit repository configuration excluding the Remotion marketing videos under `artifacts/` and the GitHub Action source under `github/` from the analysis | `.ort.yml` | Neither is part of the shipped software; needed for the OSPO SBOM |
| 2026-09-21 | Added Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct from the reuse-template | `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` | Upstream has no code of conduct file |
| 2026-09-21 | Removed the upstream `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `SECURITY.md`; they describe the upstream project's processes and do not apply to this fork | `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md` | Avoid misleading contributors; T-Systems processes apply |
